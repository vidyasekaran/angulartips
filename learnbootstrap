Installed bootstrap followed 2 sites

1.https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap

npm i @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap updated "angular.json" the below

"styles": [
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
]

npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap

import {NgbModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';
 
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [NgbModule, ...],
  ...
})
export class YourAppModule {
}

Alternatively you could only import modules with components you need, ex. pagination and alert. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resulting bundle will be smaller in this case.
--------------------------------------------------

import {NgbPaginationModule, NgbAlertModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';
 
@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [NgbPaginationModule, NgbAlertModule, ...],
  ...
})
export class YourAppModule {
}

1. How to set  background color

  a. Have tb.component.css 

.red   { color: white;background-color: red; }
.green { color: white;background-color: green;}
.blue  {color: white;background-color: blue;}
 
 b. In html 
 
  <html lang="en">
   <body>
    <div class="container">  - container is to group
      <div class="row">      -  row also is to group
        <div class="col-xs-4 red"> - xs for very small device
          Hello world
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-4 green">
          Hello world
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-4 blue">
          Hello world
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>

    
Understanding the grid system (https://leonmercanti.com/books/web-development/Bootstrap-4%20Responsive-Web-Design-_2017_.pdf)

Learn from Building our scaffolding to Finishing the grid. 

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<header class="col-md-12">
HEADER
</header>
</div>
</div>

The hierarchy for the grid system always follows the sequence of a container that wraps rows and
multiple columns. Keep in mind to always use this sequence to get a proper output.

Now that we have our .container with the first .row, let's create our first column. Every row is
subdivided into 12 parts, so you can have up to 12 columns in a single row.

To identify a column, we must follow the template of .col-*-*. The first asterisk means the viewport for
the column, and the other one means the size of the column. We will explain more about that, but to create
our first column, we create a column identified by .col-md-12 inside our row:


In this column, the md in.col-md-12 means that for the viewport medium (which means the md identifier),
the column must have a 12-column width. In other words, the column fills the entire width of this row.
This column will fill the complete width because it is our header, and as we can see in the previous
image, this row is composed of just a single row.


Refer PAge 63 in (https://leonmercanti.com/books/web-development/Bootstrap-4%20Responsive-Web-Design-_2017_.pdf)


Now, to make the gray area, we will use a class in Bootstrap called .jumbotron. The jumbotron is a
flexible Bootstrap component that can extend to the entire viewport to showcase some content, in this case
the header. So, wrap the container inside a div.jumbotron:
<div class="jumbotron">
<div class="container">
<!-- row 1 -->
<div class="row">
<header class="col-md-12">
</header>
</div>
</div>
</div>


Start from PAge 64.







You can easily switch the actual example grid with a fluid full-width layout. To do so, replace the farthest
.container with .container-fluid:
<div class="container-fluid">
â€¦
</div>
